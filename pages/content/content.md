# Test Sidescroller

![](/assets/content/sidescroller_screenshot.png)

Intended for absolute beginners, everything is made in place and doesn't use many of the advanced property markup and configuration in Simple. The level mesh is simply an `obj` file which can be modified. If you want to dive right in, this would be a good simulation to try tinkering in.

Use the arrow keys to move left/right, control to jump, and, if you collect the little ammo box, shift to shoot. Bumping one of the enemies or falling off sends you back to the beginning. There is no goal/objective.

# Melee

![](/assets/content/melee_screenshot.png)

Our actual, in-development version of Super Melee from [The Ur-Quan Masters](https://pistolshrimpgames.com/uqm/). This will be updated regularly as we work on it and is representative of what will be in the finished version of [The Ur-Quan Masters 2](https://pistolshrimpgames.com/uqm2/)

This is extremely complex data that will likely not be a great starting point for learning the tools, but has templates of highly specialized things (like ships and weapons) all built in Simple that a novice could attempt to modify or duplicate. Plus, it's fun to play - especially with a friend or two (if you can get [multiplayer](/pages/simple/simple_tool.html#multiplayer-config) going)!

For testing by yourself, after running and selecting a ship, the backslash (`\`) key will bring up a debug menu, letting you add an AI ship - which may or may not work well - to fight against or do other things.
